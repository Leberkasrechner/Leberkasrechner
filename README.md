# Installation

To run this code, you will need:

1. A Webserver
2. PHP
3. A MySQL-Instance
4. The [npm](https://npmjs.com) package manager
5. The [Composer Package Manager](https://getcomposer.org/) for PHP dependencies

## Set up the Database

To set up the database, you'll only have to run the prepared `database_setup.sql` script. It creates a database `leberkasrechner` with all the neccessary tables, indexes, constraints etc.

Now, if you wish to fill up your database with butcher data, run the `update_butchers.py` script:

```bash
python3 update_butchers.py
py update_butchers.py
```

The `database_setup.sql` script above does *not* set up the database user which does all the queries for website visitors not logged in. You have to do that yourself. Run the following SQL snipped **from your DB root account:**

```sql
CREATE USER 'lview'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'YOURSTRONGPASSWORD';
GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'lview'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON leberkasrechner.author TO 'lview'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON leberkasrechner.license TO 'lview'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON leberkasrechner.image TO 'lview'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON leberkasrechner.image_butcher TO 'lview'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON leberkasrechner.butchers TO 'lview'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT (`id`, `edit`, `admin`) ON `leberkasrechner`.`users` TO 'lview'@'localhost'; 
ALTER USER 'lview'@'localhost' ;
```

**Don't forget to replace the password with your own, strong one.** This db user will be used for the sql-queries needed for the readonly-part of the website (*not the internal part of it*). You can also change the username (`lview` in the snippet), but that's not neccessary.

Now, we'll need a second account which can create new database accounts and has the rights to do so. With this account, the code will be able to create new database accounts with `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UDPATE` and `DELETE` rights for *website frontend accounts*. To create this user, run the following SQL-snippet **from your DB root account:**

```sql
CREATE USER 'lusercreate'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'ANOTHER_STRONGPASSWORD';
GRANT INSERT ON leberkasrechner.users TO 'lusercreate'@'localhost';
GRANT CREATE USER ON leberkasrechner.* TO 'lusercreate'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON leberkasrechner TO 'lusercreate'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

Again, don't forget to replace the password with your own, strong one and **do NOT use the same password as for the `lview` account!**

## Storing Database Credentials

Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` file. This file will store your MySQL database credentials.

Here's what each variable in the `.env` file represents:

- `DBSERVER`: The IP address of your database server. Typically, this is `127.0.0.1` for a local database.
- `DBPORT`: The port number your database server is listening on. The default for MySQL and MariaDB is usually `3306`.
- `DBUSER`: The username for your database *view* user (`lview` in this example) .
- `DBPASSWORD`: The password for your database *view* user. Keep this secure!
- `UC_DBUSER`: The username for your database user *with extended rights* (`lcreateuser` in this example)
- `UC_DBPASSWORD`: The password for your database user *with extended rights*. Keep this secure!
- `DBNAME`: The name of the database you want to connect to. (Note: Currently, only the name `leberkasrechner` is supported due to some bad programming)

Hereâ€™s an example of what your `.env` file should look like:

```ini
DBSERVER = "127.0.0.1"
DBPORT = 3306
DBUSER = "DBUSER"
DBPASSWORD = "YOURSTRONGPASSWORD"
UC_DBUSER = "ANOTER_DBUSER"
UC_DBPASSWORD = "ANOTHER_STRONGPASSWORD"
DBNAME = "leberkasrechner"
```

## Installing the dependencies

Last, you will have to install the node modules given in the `package.json` file:
```bash
npm install
```

6.  A PHP package manager, preferably Composer. Requirements are listet in `composer.json`. To install the requirements, run

```bash
composer install
```
